# Bounty Hunter Docker
A docker image based on Debian Testing that builds common tools that I'm using for recon. This will be updated as I improve my workflow. All the tools are set up so the binaries are in the path.

## Tools
* nmap
* altdns
* amass
* arjun
* dirsearch
* findomain
* httprobe
* massdns
* meg
* masscan
